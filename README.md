# bookmark-project
a website to track and keep check of nice bookmarks and to-visits

<p>
	This is a simple web project to display and keep track of all my bookmarks, links, and to-visit pages on the web. To say it straight, any site, book, and links I would like to visit back in the future/save for future use will be tracked here. This is really just a way for me to organize links rather than piling on my browser's bookmarks tab.
