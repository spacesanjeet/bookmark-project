# bookmark-project

I will consider this project as an experiment. I don't know yet where this will go. In the beginning I wanted this site to hold and maintain all my bookmark links but now that I have grapsed the idea fully, I understand that it may be difficult to maintain all the links on the site that I come across on a daily basis, and thus to have a site to maintain bookmarks isn't really a nice idea.

Also, I have already have blogs on this site, in the "thoughts" section. I don't know where I am going with this one because I want to have a place to put my random rants and opinions that I don't want to put on my main blog. My main blog sits at my personal site [spacesanjeet.me](https://spacesanjeet.me/).

Maybe, I will consider this as my 2nd site? I don't know. I will probably get rid of the bookmarks in the near future and treat the site to post all the random life events and rants that I don't consider worthy to be on my professional site. Updates and stuff such as my reading lists, my current watchlist, the projects I am working on, and perhaps even some music and videos. I will see to it. For now though, there is no clear path as to where this is going.
