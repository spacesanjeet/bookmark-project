    <p>Today when I was reading the newspaper, I saw this clip on the 1st page.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/dth-ott-clip.jpg" alt="newspaper clip with the headline - 'DTH companies lose revenue due to rise in OTT">
      <figcaption>newspaper clip from "Patrika"</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>The news clip basically reads that the DTH (direct-to-consumer) firms have started to lose revenue as consumers are giving more preference to OTT (over-the-top media) services. The clip quotes <em>Deloitte India</em> that the combined revenue of the 4 major DTH operators has decreased from 12,284 crores in the FY 2022 to 11,072 crores in FY 2023.</p>
    <p>This gives power to the saying that consumers are leaving DTH services to give preference to OTT. The clip quotes <em>Dish TV executive director Manoj Dhobhal</em> saying that earlier people utilized DTH services as a primary medium to watch television, but since the Covid-19 pandemic, OTT has gained popularity. Now people are watching content according to their budget and preferences.</p>
    <p>In March 2021, there were around 70 million DTH subscribers that has been reduced to 62 million in June 2024.</p><hr>
    <p>Why I am writing about this news clip is because in the first quarter of 2024, I worked on a live project in my 1st semester on the topic - <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10AuOo5xxFp-9QPRGOBxq0iSTvODl1Z93/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104576106460497126580&rtpof=true&sd=true"> Gen-Z Viewing Preferences (OTT vs. Traditional Screens)</a></strong>. The project focused on the content and entertainment habits of the Gen-Z population and wanted answers on where they are consuming content - OTT or traditional television?</p>
    <p>The results weren't surprising at all. Majority of the respondents (52.7%) said that they use OTT platforms such as Netflix and Prime Video for their entertainment needs as opposed to small minority (27.5%) who do so on linear television (cable and satellite). A staggering number of respondents (82.36%) said that convenience plays a crucial role in determining their selection of entertainment media. There is little doubt as to what it means.</p> 
    <p>Traditional linear television rely on ads and commercials while OTT platforms give users the power to remove all ads and distractions albeit at a higher subscription price than normal. But to have the convenience to do so is enough of an incentive for Gen-Z population to steer away from linear television and watch whatever they want, whenever they want at their own convenience and preference.</p>
    <p>The rise in sports streaming and availability of free IPL (Indian Premier League) matches on Jio Cinema in last couple of years have bought more people to digital than anything else previously. Indian market is far from its saturation level when it comes to digital adoption and given the growth, it will hardly be a surprise if in a decade from now, DTH becomes a thing of the past.</p>
