    <p>Rodri played 63 matches across 10 competition throughout last season and had to suffer just one defeat - against Manchester United in the FA Cup final. That is as close to a perfect season one can imagine. He won 4 championships, 3 for club and 1 for his country. In 2022-23, Messi won the Ballon d'Or for helping secure a world cup title for Argentina and denied Haaland who had a similar prolific season in Europe. Putting weight behind national level trophies isn't a new. Modric won the award in 2018 ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo for his great European season topped off with helping Croatia reach the world cup final.</p>
    <p>I don't get why fans would argue that Rodri has robbed/denied Vinicius Junior of his rightful Ballon d'Or award. The Real Madrid star forward was diabolical for his national side last season. The moment Rodri helped Spain clinch the Euros, it should have been a done deal. A good G+A along with Champions League is not enough when you are up against a player who has similar success in Europe along with the Euros.</p>
    <p>Junior scored 26 goals and provided 11 assists in all competitions last season. Combined, that is only 11 more than a G+A of 26 that Rodri secured being a defensive midfielder. Junior also played 10 national matches for Brazil in the season and scored just 2 goals and provided 2 assists in all. I don't know how people can even dare to question the credibility of Rodri's Ballon d'Or success.</p>
    <p>I saw few comments on instagram that go along these lines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a DM winning the Ballon d'Or says how finished this sport is</li>
      <li>if national trophies matter, why didn't Carvajal win it?</li>
      <li>world vs Real Madrid</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I don't know how to respond to these stupid comments but here is my two cents: a defensive midfielder winning the Ballon d'Or award doesn't say how finished this sport is. It tells me how competitive the sport is. A sport where a DM playing for a top side can go toe-to-toe against a forward playing for another top side.</p>
    <p>Also it is hilarious that people are saying that if national trophies matter, Carvajal should have won it. Isn't that hypocrisy and countering against their own argument that a DM winning the Ballon d'Or means the sport is finished? How come they will defend a right-back winning the award?</p>
    <p>Also no, the world is not against Madrid. Or perhaps, yes, the world is against Madrid. When you want to be the best in the world, you have to face the world. The argument should really be: was RM's collective success enough for Junior to win the award? And the answer is a simple no. Because his opponent won more than him. End of the debate.</p>
    <p>I congratulate Rodri on winning the Ballon d'Or fair and sqaure. And wish him a speedy recovery from the injury that has caused an early season finish for him.</p>
