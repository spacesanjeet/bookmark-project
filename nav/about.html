    <p>Hello world! ABOUT</p>
    <p>Welcome to my personal internet collective! The idea is to save and preserve links to visit later rather than letting them die out in my browser's bookmarks tab.</p>
    <p>So what basically started as a plain and simple bookmark collection project is now more than that I believe. I wonder if I can post regular <em>updates</em> here about the stuff I am currently reading, writing, and working on. Talk about why certain links are bookmarked and stuff such as my other projects.</p>
    <p>Mind you, this is in no way a replacement for my <a href="https://spacesanjeet.me">personal site</a> and will only host links and updates that I don't think are relevant to be posted on my main site. All regular blogs will be made on the linked site, except for niche and small time updates that I consider are not worthy to be put on there.</p>
    <p>As usual, work in progress, thanks for looking around. Have a great day/night!</p>
