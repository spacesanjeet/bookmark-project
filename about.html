    <p>The idea is this:
    To organize and save links in a manner which is easy to follow, find, and track. Easy accessibility and no forgetting about links rotting under bookmarks tabs never to be visited again.</p>
    <p>Will I ever get to update this extensively? I don't know. And that is the point. This is to check how feasible it is. Will I ever end up using this site rather than my browser bookmarks tab instead? I don't know. Only time will tell but that doesn't stop me from trying this out.</p>
